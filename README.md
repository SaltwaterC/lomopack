LomoPack
========

Set of script-fu plugins to simulate a "lomo" effect.
Gimp version tested: 2.6

Installation
------------

1. Just copy lomopack.scm in the *scripts* directory of Gimp
	> /home/user/.gimp-2.6/scripts
2. Restart Gimp or refresh scripts from 
	> Filters > Script-Fu

Basic Usage
-----------

Filters are located in: **Filters > Jackroom**

### Lomo Border

Add a blur and a vignette effect to borders.

### Lomo Burn

Add a random film burn. Being random, there are no options. Just try.

### Lomo Color

This is the prime filter of the set. *Lomo Color* generates a vivid image
as in high saturated films.
With strong shadows it is recommended to add some luminosity; with high
contrast images is better to remove some contrast using the *[PRE]* 
options.
